# Weekly-Growth-Accounting-Chart
## Insights on user growth:
The number of new users varies each week, possibly due to factors like marketing or updates. The number of resurrected users stays mostly steady with occasional increases. But the number of churned users is consistently high, often more than the new and resurrected users combined, which is concerning. The quick ratio is quite unstable which is indicating inconsistent user retention and acquisition. The retention rate is consistently low, suggesting that many users are not staying engaged with the platform.

## Answer to the questions: 
- Can retained users be 0 in some week?
It is highly unlikely for retained users to be 0 in any week unless all users from the previous week have churned.
- Can churned users be 0 in some week? 
Given the current data it is improbable for the churned users to be zero but it is possible. And for it to be possible, previous week active users would not stop being active.
- Can resurrected users be 0 in some week?
Yes, resurrected users can be 0 if no previously inactive users return in a given week.
